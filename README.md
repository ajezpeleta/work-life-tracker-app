# Work Life Tracker App

An app that tracks how much the user spends time **working** versus **living** each day. It can also report to the user much time is spent doing either to give them a valuable insight on their daily lives.

## Features and To-do

The app is designed to be simple to look at and easy to use, to be unintrusive as possible. For now, here are the core features.

- [x] A button timer that toggles between **WORK** and **LIFE**
- [ ] A button that pauses the **WORK-LIFE** toggle button and tracks **SLEEP**
- [ ] A dashboard to monitor your **WORK**, **LIFE**, and **SLEEP** hours
